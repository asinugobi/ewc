# EWC Research Directory

This project focuses on transfer learning. More specifically, we would like to analyze the transfer implications of transferring from our originally trained dataset (or domain) to a new dataset and the resulting performances on the originally trained task. 

## Transfer within MNIST 

This module focuses on transfer learning within MNIST. Please see the `mnist` directory for more details. 

## Transfer from ImageNet to CIFAR  

This module focuses on transfer learning from ImageNet to CIFAR. This module is currently incomplete, but there is a working Keras + Tensorflow implementation, which you can find [here](https://github.com/asinugobi/layerwise_ewc).
